# LLM_study_project1_build_a_transformer

Solve some coding problems from https://www.deep-ml.com/problems. Build a classical transformer model based on Happy_LLM.
Some works will be done first on colab or local VS code, then I will uploaded them into repo.
I learn llm from two repos: llm_interview_note and Happy_LLM. Also I study a lot from Andrej Karpathy's Youtube channel to get an overall picture of the entire architecture. I use waylandzhang's blog and videos as a good example of self-learning process.

In next step I will work on Juliye's GRPO project.
